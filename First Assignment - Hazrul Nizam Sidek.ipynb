    "#### Definitions of Machine Learning:\n",
    "1. Machine learning technology teaches computers how to perform tasks by learning from data â€“ instead of being explicitly programmed. [1]\n",
    "2. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline geared toward the technological development of human knowledge. Machine learning allows computers to handle new situations via analysis, self-training, observation and experience. [2]\n",
    "3. Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example data or past experience. We have a model defined up to some parameters, and learning is the execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or past experience. The model may be _predictive_ to make predictions in the future, or _descriptive_ to gain knowledge from data, or both. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Machine Learning applications (5):\n",
    "1. Classification or detection of spam online reviews - Whether online reviews posted are genuine, meaningless, or deceptive. [4]\n",
    "2. Recommender systems - Software tools and techniques providing suggestions for items to be of use to a user. The suggestions relate to various decision-making processes, such as what items to buy, what music to listen to, or what online news to read. [5]\n",
    "3. Credit card fraud detection. [6]\n",
    "4. Healthcare - Prediction of chronic disease outbreak in disease-frequent communities. [7]\n",
    "5. Rail network predictive maintenance. [8]\n"
